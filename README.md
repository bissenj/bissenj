#### About

I'm a professional Full Stack Developer since 2004 who has worked with a variety of organizations from large fortune 500 companies, to non-profits, and even my own local small business.


#### Iâ€™m currently working on ####
* Becoming a better Front End Developer and Designer.
* Finding a role where I can use my skills to make life better for people.
* A web and mobile project linking a person's identity, goals, timetracking and organization skills.
